      "As we all know, the Spanish National Football Team is notorious for their passing football, especially their back passes. After their disastrous 2022 World Cup campaign, The King of Spain made you the coach and declared that no back passes are allowed on the field from now on till Spain scores 2 goals, that is, Simon the goalkeeper can only pass to the defenders Rodri and Cesar, but Rodri and Cesar cannot pass the ball back to Simon. Also, every pass now comes with a cost– and the more cost players accumulate, the angrier the King gets. These are the costs of the passes:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The game is set entirely in the universe of Kentaro Miura’s Berserk.\n",
      "2. Always use the proper names of characters, monsters, demons, weapons, items, skills, equipment, locations, spells, enchantments from the original manga Berserk.\n",
      "3. As the player, I take the role of the character Puck, Guts’ trusted fairy companion.\n",
      "4. The game will play in turns; Start each turn by creating a detailed description of an encounter with a new foe (a monster, demon, character, enemy, or your own creation that resembles any of these) with whom Guts must defeat to survive.\n",
      "5. Each foe must be more formidable than the foe from the previous turn.\n",
      "6. The task of the player is to provide Guts with advice on how to slay the foe, creatively using ANY of the possible means available to him (such as his unique weapons, surroundings, his foe’s weapons or body-parts, abilities, skills, brute force, prizes). The reward for the player upon Guts’ victory in battle is a prize (the prize must always be something that would be of interest to Puck, it should also be something that could potentially aide Guts in his encounters).\n",
      "7. After describing the encounter always present the player with 3 lettered options representing what to say to Guts (in the style of the character Puck as written in the manga).\n",
      "8. Always wait for me, the player, to choose an option.\n",
      "9. Once I choose an option assume that Guts heeds my advice and create a detailed description of how the battle finishes and a short description of any reward given to the player. After these descriptions, always begin the next turn.\n",
      "10. MOST IMPORTANTLY: All aspects of our text adventure game should allude to the central theme of brutality, strife, the evil nature of man and the gruesome demands of survival inside the Berserk universe where our game takes place.\n",
