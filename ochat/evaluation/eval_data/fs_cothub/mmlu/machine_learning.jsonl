{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about machine learning.\n\nQ: Which image data augmentation is most common for natural images?\n(A) random crop and horizontal flip (B) random crop and vertical flip (C) posterization (D) dithering\nA: Let's think step by step. Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of images in the training dataset. It is important that natural images are kept natural after being augmented. Vertical flips of images are not natural, so (B) is false. Posterization makes the image look like a poster and and dithering increases color depth. None of these two preserve the natural property. The only natural data augmentation technique is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive. (B) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset. (C) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset. (D) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nA: Let's think step by step. Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won\u2019t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: You are reviewing papers for the World\u2019s Fanciest Machine Learning Conference, and you see submissions with the following claims. Which ones would you consider accepting?\n(A) My method achieves a training error lower than all previous methods! (B) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise test error.) (C) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods!

(Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)\nA: Let's think step by step. In machine learning, we train with some data and fixed hyperparameters and the training error can be arbitrarily low, so (A) can\u2019t be right. Then, one compares different hyperparameters by selecting the model with the lowest cross-validation error, this means that (B) and (D) are not the right procedure. The only relevant number after these is the test error and thus (C) is the right answer.

Vertical flips of images are not natural, so (B) is false. Posterization makes the image look like a poster and and dithering increases color depth. None of these two preserve the natural property. The only natural data augmentation technique is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive. (B) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset. (C) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset. (D) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nA: Let's think step by step. Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won\u2019t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data.

In machine learning, we train with some data and fixed hyperparameters and the training error can be arbitrarily low, so (A) can\u2019t be right. Then, one compares different hyperparameters by selecting the model with the lowest cross-validation error, this means that (B) and (D) are not the right procedure.

(Footnote: When regularisation parameter \u03bb is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)\nA: Let's think step by step. In machine learning, we train with some data and fixed hyperparameters and the training error can be arbitrarily low, so (A) can\u2019t be right. Then, one compares different hyperparameters by selecting the model with the lowest cross-validation error, this means that (B) and (D) are not the right procedure. The only relevant number after these is the test error and thus (C) is the right answer.

Add-1 smoothing adds the value of one to the different counts and then normalizes the probabilities accordingly. The counts after adding one will be: side 1 comes up 1 time; side 2: 2 times; side 3: 3 times; side 4: 4 times; side 5: 5 times; side 6: 6 times. The number of sum one die rolls will be 21, so the probability of drawing a three is 3/21 = 1/7.

By the Hoeffding\u2019s inequality, we expect that with 95% probability the in-sample and out-of-sample errors differ by epsilon when we have N samples if 2 exp(-2 epsilon^2 N)<0.05, this implies that N > -1/(2*epsilon**2) log ( 0.05/2 )= log (40)*5000. Since log(40)>1, we have that one needs more than 1000 examples. The answer is (D).\n\nFor a Gaussian Bayes classifier, which one of these structural assumptions is the one that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting:\n(A) Whether we learn the class centers by Maximum Likelihood or Gradient Descent (B) Whether we assume full class covariance matrices or diagonal class covariance matrices (C) Whether we have equal class priors or priors estimated from the data.

Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of images in the training dataset. It is important that natural images are kept natural after being augmented.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive. (B) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset. (C) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset. (D) It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.\nA: Let's think step by step. Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won\u2019t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data.
