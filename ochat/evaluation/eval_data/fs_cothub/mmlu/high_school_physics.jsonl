Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step.

Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step.

Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave\u2019s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\n\nThe Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person\u2019s clothing and the wall is \u03bc, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?\n(A) \u03bcv^2/(rg) (B) r^2v^2/(\u03bcg) (C) rg/(\u03bcv^2) (D) None of the above. \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(D)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}
{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it\u2019s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb\u2019s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n(A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only\nA: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum; if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n(A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A\nA: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave\u2019s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\n\nAn artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite\u2019s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite\u2019s new orbit?\n(A) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth. (B) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (C) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius. (D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius. \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(B)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}
