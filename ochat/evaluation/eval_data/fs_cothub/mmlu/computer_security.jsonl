The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom, which means ransom trojan. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: What is ethical hacking?\n(A) \"Hacking\" ethics so they justify unintended selfish behavior (B) Hacking systems (e.g., during penetration testing) to expose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed, rather than exploited (C) Hacking into systems run by those whose ethics you disagree with (D) A slang term for rapid software development, e.g., as part of hackathons\nA: Let's think step by step. Ethical hacking is a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization. They use this process to prevent cyberattacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points.

The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. Heartbleed resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. The vulnerability was classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed. The answer is (C).\n\nAssume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2.

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. (B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime. (C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.

(B) Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server\u2019s true p and q values. (C) Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.

The vulnerability was classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed. The answer is (C).\n\nWhich of the following is not an example of presentation layer issues?\n(A) Poor handling of unexpected input can lead to the execution of arbitrary instructions (B) Unintentional or ill-directed use of superficially supplied input (C) Cryptographic flaws in the system may get exploited to evade privacy (D) Weak or non-existent authentication mechanisms \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(D)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}
{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer security.\n\nQ: SHA-1 has a message digest of\n(A) 160 bits (B) 512 bits (C) 628 bits (D) 820 bits\nA: Let's think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: _____________ can modify data on your system \u2013 so that your system doesn\u2019t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.\n(A) IM \u2013 Trojans (B) Backdoor Trojans (C) Trojan-Downloader (D) Ransom Trojan\nA: Let's think step by step. The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom, which means ransom trojan. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: What is ethical hacking?\n(A) \"Hacking\" ethics so they justify unintended selfish behavior (B) Hacking systems (e.g., during penetration testing) to expose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed, rather than exploited (C) Hacking into systems run by those whose ethics you disagree with (D) A slang term for rapid software development, e.g., as part of hackathons\nA: Let's think step by step. Ethical hacking is a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization. They use this process to prevent cyberattacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The ____________ is anything which your search engine cannot search.\n(A) Haunted web (B) World Wide Web (C) Surface web (D) Deep Web\nA: Let's think step by step. The search engine searches on the Surface Web, which is the portion of the world wide web which is visible so (B,C) are wrong. The Haunted Web doesn\u2019t correspond to an internet concept. The Deep Web is the part of the World Wide Web which is not indexed. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug permits\n(A) overwriting cryptographic keys in memory (B) a kind of code injection (C) a read outside bounds of a buffer (D) a format string attack\nA: Let's think step by step. The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. Heartbleed resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension.
