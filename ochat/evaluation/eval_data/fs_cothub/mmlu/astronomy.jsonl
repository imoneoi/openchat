{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nIf you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location then with no other information you can estimate:\n(A) Its speed relative to you (B) Its composition (C) Its size (D) Its distance from you \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(D)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}

(B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer.

(C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.

(B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step.

How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A).

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nWhat is the significance of the 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system?\n(A) The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.

{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nWhat is not true of Jupiter's magnetic field?\n(A) it is about 20000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field (B) it traps charged particles from Io's volcanoes in a \"plasma torus\" around the planet (C) it causes spectacular auroral displays at Jupiter's north and south poles (D) it switches polarity every 11 years \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(D)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}

(C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust.

How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nWhy is it thought that the climate on Mars changed when the planet lost its strong magnetic field?\n(A) without a strong magnetic field the ozone layer was destroyed by the solar wind which stopped the greenhouse effect and cooled Mars down. (B) without a strong magnetic field which enhances the greenhouse effect Mars cooled down. (C) without a strong magnetic field the solar wind stripped away most of the atmosphere significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling Mars down (D) without a strong magnetic field the planet recieves fewer charged particles from the solar wind and therefore is not heated as much \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(C)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nYou observe the visible spectrum of a star viewed through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas.\n(A) You see only the star\u2019s blackbody spectrum. (B) You see the star\u2019s blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen. (C) You see only emission lines characteristic of hydrogen. (D) You see only emission lines characteristic of the star\u2019s composition. \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(B)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}

{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nA sand bag has a mass of 5kg and weight 50N on Earth.

(B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nEarth has been gradually warming over the past few decades.

(D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nMoons cause/contribute to which of the following?\n(A) stability of particles within rings.

{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.

(B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer.

How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$.

(D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A).

(B) Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower. (C) Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.

Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nThe sky is blue because\n(A) the Sun mainly emits blue light. (B) the atmosphere absorbs mostly blue light. (C) molecules scatter red light more effectively than blue light. (D) molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light. \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(D)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}

{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust.

The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Why is Mars red?\n(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals. (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nA: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A).\n\nThe lunar maria are:\n(A) ancient heavily cratered highlands (B) dark lavas inside volcanic calderas (C) dark lavas filling older impact basins (D) the bright regions on the Moon \nA: Let's think step by step.", "label": "(C)", "options": ["(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)"]}
{"question": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\n(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.\nA: Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\n(A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more\nA: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\n(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nA: Let's think step by step.
